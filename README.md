# $scope.$watch and $scope.$watchCollection

## Overview

We can observe changes to variables using `$scope.$watch` - this is awesome, but we need to make sure we're smart with them!

## Objectives

- Describe watching Models with $scope.$watch
- Describe $scope.$watchCollection
- Describe deep Model watching
- Write a $scope.$watch function
- Write a $scope.$watchCollection function

## Watching models

In our controllers, we can watch when values update using `$scope.$watch`. We pass through two functions to this - the first one is a function that returns the value we want to watch. The second is the function that gets called when the value is updated.

```js
function SomeController($scope) {
	var ctrl = this;
	ctrl.search = '';

	$scope.$watch(function () {
		return ctrl.search;
	}, function (newValue, oldValue) {
		console.log('value updated!');
	});
}

angular
	.module('app')
	.controller('SomeController', SomeController);
```
```html
<input ng-model="ctrl.search" />
```

When a user types into our input, our function will get called with its old value and its new value. For instance, if we typed the letter `r` into our input, it would get called with `oldValue` equal to `''` and `newValue` equal to `'r'`.

## Watching objects/arrays

We've looked at observing strings, now let's watch objects/arrays. We can do this with `$scope.$watchCollection`


```js
function SomeController($scope) {
	var ctrl = this;
	ctrl.collection = {
		id: 5,
		name: 'Test'
	};

	$scope.$watchCollection(function () {
		return ctrl.collection;
	}, function (newValue, oldValue) {
		console.log('value updated!');
	});
}

angular
	.module('app')
	.controller('SomeController', SomeController);
```

This will then fire out whenever we change any item in that object! However, this doesn't work that well when we change a value inside an object inside an object. For instance, if we have an object with the variable `user` and update the `name` property inside it from `Bob` to `Alice`, we will get notified. Same as if we removed the property, or added a new one. However, we don't get the same level of checks on deep nested objects.

## Deep-watching objects/arrays

We can deep watch objects/arrays by going back to `$scope.$watch`, but passing in a third parameter of `true` to tell Angular to deep watch the collection.

```js
function SomeController($scope) {
	var ctrl = this;
	ctrl.collection = {
		id: 5,
		name: 'Test',
		country: {
			name: 'United States'
		}
	};

	$scope.$watch(function () {
		return ctrl.collection;
	}, function (newValue, oldValue) {
		console.log('value updated!');
	}, true);
}

angular
	.module('app')
	.controller('SomeController', SomeController);
```

Before, with `$scope.$watchCollection`, if we had updated the country's name, we wouldn't have got a callback fired. However, with `$scope.$watch`, we do! Just be careful - this requires more resources to check the object, so use them only when you must.

Angular doesn't deep watch by default as it is more intensive and requires more computation time in order to find differences. If it did do it by default, our digest cycle would be a lot slower!

Be careful using these functions - they mean that extra checks are added to the digest cycle (on top of the ones automatically created by Angular), meaning that every time it is run, it takes even longer.
